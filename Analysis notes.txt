Headers 
0DP1= day0, Dry Pistachio, Rep1
3DA1= day 3,Dry Almond, Rep1



Headers changed to above  from original file: ?\given files\ AllTreatmentsFinal.xls

note  both RT and Cal'c columns have repeated values so  wont import

Tried using the chemical id on colum 1 and it wont import in R so go back to 

needed to use =Concat(A2,"/",B2) to create a unique value of the two

Note when  the replace with smallest value /2  function gives inf becasue the whole row is 0.

Went back to excel and deleted all the rows where the sum of all the variables =0 and then 
reran with the replazezero function
Cleared everything and re-ran 

======================data wrangling===============================================
after deleting all the rows with sum=0 and  creating anRT/Cal colum and setting all the data
as numbers still get the error

"Error in read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  : 
  duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed"






Will begin with  orig data  and attempt in this order:
1 remove duplicate row names
2 create RT/Cal column using concat function above
3 create sum colum and if sum=0 all that in that row =0 remove that 

test import  doint it this way it loaded without Errors
4. when testing str() all numbers came out as char, need to go back and select all data and
	format as numbers

=======================================================================================
testing new headers DPD1R1= DryPistachio Day 1 Rep1



=======================testing using chemical name rather than rt/calc on x axis data column================
DataFormattedV3.cvs		set up

actually run DataFormattedV4 which has the names only rather than RT.cal
